# Exercise Protocol and Guidelines

## Core Requirements

- 6 hours of exercise per week
- 3 days of strength training
- 3 days of cardio
- 150 minutes of moderate activity (conversation-capable)
- 75 minutes of vigorous exercise (conversation-difficult)
- Include flexibility, balance and mobility exercises

## Key Principles

### Injury Prevention
- Prioritize injury prevention over performance
- Avoid exercises that cause discomfort or pain
- Maintain proper form and technique
- Progress gradually and systematically

### Habit Formation
- Exercise daily (unless medically contraindicated)
- Make it non-negotiable
- Remove decision-making from the process
- Establish consistent timing and routine

### Daily Movement Guidelines
- Post-meal activity: 5-10 minutes after each meal
- Desk breaks: Move every 30 minutes
- Incorporate natural movement throughout day

## Gender-Specific Considerations

### Premenopausal Women
- Follicular Phase (First Half):
  - Focus on high-intensity training
  - Prioritize strength training
  - Optimal for muscle growth and recovery
  - Take advantage of enhanced performance

- Luteal Phase (Second Half):
  - Reduce to lower-intensity activities
  - Focus on Zone 2 cardio
  - Lighter strength training
  - Account for slower recovery times

### Postmenopausal Women
- Prioritize:
  - Strength training
  - High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
  - Weight-bearing exercises
- Benefits:
  - Maintains muscle mass
  - Improves insulin sensitivity
  - Protects bone density
  - Reduces osteoporosis risk

## Scientific Evidence

### Mortality and Health Benefits
- 26%-31% reduction in all-cause mortality
- 28%-38% reduction in cardiovascular disease risk
- Up to 35% lower risk of premature death with good muscular strength
- 21%-23% lower mortality risk with 150-299 minutes/week of vigorous activity
- 35-42% mortality reduction when combining moderate and vigorous activity

### Metabolic Benefits
- Muscle tissue burns 3x more calories than fat (6 vs 2 calories per pound)
- Brief intense activities (1-2 minutes) can lower cancer risk
- Improved insulin sensitivity and metabolic health

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Start with proper form and technique
2. Progress gradually to prevent injury
3. Listen to your body and adjust accordingly
4. Maintain consistency over intensity
5. Include all components: strength, cardio, flexibility, and balance
