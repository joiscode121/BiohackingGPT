# Sleep Optimization Protocol
- **Goal:** Enhance sleep quality for recovery and cognitive performance.
- **Protocol:** Maintain a consistent sleep schedule (7-9 hours nightly), avoid screens 1 hour before bed, and keep the bedroom dark and cool (60-67Â°F). Use a pre-sleep routine like reading or meditation.
- **Safety:** Consult a doctor if you suspect sleep disorders (e.g., insomnia, apnea).
- **Timing:** Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily, even on weekends.
- **Contraindications:** Avoid caffeine or heavy meals 4-6 hours before bed if sensitive.
