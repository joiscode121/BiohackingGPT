# Cold Exposure Protocol
- **Goal:** Boost resilience, improve circulation, and reduce inflammation.
- **Protocol:** Take a 2-3 minute cold shower daily, starting with lukewarm water and gradually decreasing the temperature. Alternatively, immerse in cold water (50-60°F) for 1-2 minutes, 2-3 times per week.
- **Safety:** Avoid if you have heart conditions, high blood pressure, or are pregnant. Start slowly to avoid shock. Consult a doctor if unsure.
- **Timing:** Best in the morning to energize or after exercise for recovery.
- **Contraindications:** Not recommended for individuals with Raynaud’s disease or severe respiratory issues.
